## Key Findings

Though the scope of this project has been limited, the city comparison has revealed some interesting findings.

* **The effectiveness of stay-at-home orders is unclear.** These findings indicate mixed results on the effectiveness of lockdowns. For cities with earlier outbreaks, like Philadelphia, a lockdown that coincided with a spike in cases appeared to curb the rate of infection and be an effective tool to manage COVID-19. For other cities that did not experience an early outbreak, such as Jacksonville or Phoenix, the stay-at-home order did not have a clear impact on the infection rate. Of course, it is impossible to know if the early lockdowns kept potential outbreaks from occurring, but this data suggests that other factors contributed to the timing of outbreaks besides the stay-at-home orders. 

* **Foot traffic generally decreased before stay-at-home orders went into effect.** In each of the six cities, business traffic drastically decreased before governments declared any official restrictions on businesses. This suggests that residents were uncomfortable visiting establishments in the early days of the pandemic and stayed home on their own accord. This pattern captures the fear and anxiety felt across the nation in March 2020, and also demonstrates that personal preference and accountability is likely the most effective strategy at keeping people home. 

* **Full-service restaurants drive a substantial portion of foot traffic in all cities**. These establishments have also faced the largest reduction in traffic overall. While eating indoors is a high-risk activity and these restrictions has been a necessary step in containing the virus spread, this trend is quite worrisome for cities. With full-service restaurants accounting for a substantial share of foot traffic in cities and many restaurants struggling to stay afloat during 2020, it begs the question if they will be able to recover this foot traffic after the pandemic. Depending on the region of the U.S., malls also appear to be quite a popular destination. Malls, on the other hand, have not appeared to suffer from the drastic decrease in foot traffic.

* **Mask use is not consistent** across major U.S. cities, but it appears that the majority of residents wear a mask when in close proximity to other people. Since the data only provides a snapshot of mask wearing in July 2020, it is hard to tell from this analysis how much mask compliance contributed to outbreaks across the cities.

## Continued Research

Going forward, there are numerous ways to expand this research. It would be interesting to include more cities in the analysis or experiment with other groupings, such as urban and rural areas. As large cities tend to be more progressive, they likely had similar approaches to COVID-19 management. Almost all of the cities instituted early lockdowns and have a relatively high rate of mask wearing. Rural areas were generally more resistant to the pandemic restrictions, so it would be insightful to study and understand those differences.  

It would also be helpful to incorporate a more nuanced depiction of the pandemic restrictions and stay-at-home orders since the specifics varied by city and region. Separately, if the data are available, it would also be helpful to incorporate mask use over time. Since there was not a clear relationship between the end of stay-at-home orders and local outbreaks, more information on mask use would be helpful in strategizing how to stem the spread of COVID-19 and the city level.
